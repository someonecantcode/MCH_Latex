\section*{Welcome}
This to any Math Club Officer running the club. I originally wrote this for myself, documenting 
my entire process, but decided that this could be useful for anyone getting started.
It will have everything for you to get started and also things to potentially work on. 

\section*{Intro}
Math Club is mainly about two things:
(1) competition math and (2) math learning.\\

Math Competitions are basically the corner stone of Math Club and drives its members to
constantly be improving. Thus, it is important to obtain \key{fundraising} as it lowers costs of admissions. 
Make sure when finding more competitions around the area that they are cheap and accessible. During math club meetings, 
it will generally be split into two groups: Competition Math and Math Tutoring. \\

Good luck and enjoy your time running Math Club!
