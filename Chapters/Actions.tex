\section{Fundraising}
After everything, now to acquire funds.
First know which businesses students usually go to and compile a hit-list.
Go to the businesses and ask the manager if they are able to make a fundraising deal.

If that doesen't go well, apply for an ASB Grant by contacting one of the ASB leadership members.
Then, volunteer at concessions for funding also.

\section{Officer Positions}
This wayyyy later on near June. If you have \key{completely finished} the above,
read in the \hyperref[sec:Officer]{ Endgame section} on this.
