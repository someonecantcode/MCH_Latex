# Math Club's Handbook

WIP [haven't yet ran the club yet but will update]

Math Club's Handbook is introduction to those that are entering as an officer.
It's just a little thing I wrote that helped me organize all my thoughts. 
It has everything from planning, running, and also relevant things that also need work on.
